# ABOUT AI:
This AI belongs to the "text completion" category and is based on the "text-davinci-002" model. The model which I decided to use has been trained by OpenAI company. If you want to know more about this company and his model I invite you to visit the following link: <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion"><img title="Forks" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Link-OpenAI%3A-brightgreen"></a> 

I set the temperature factor to 0.7, this should help us to always receive different answers when we repeat the same question to the AI with slightly small variations in the text.
This parameter might create some inconsistency when we repeat math questions, the social questions in the conversation more real.
## WHAT CAN I DO WITH IT?
You can do many things,  the only limit is your imagination! I can give you some examples and advice on how I would use this smart engine:
You can ask him for any kind of information or even an opinion, it can become your virtual assistant to get job informations or simply have a chat.
<br> You can ask direct questions such as "how tall is the leaning tower of pisa" or satisfy your doubts such as "why do some people struggle to wake up early in the morning?"

## WHAT CAPABILITIES DOES AI HAVE?
There are many capabilities but I will try to enclose the major ones below:

<br><b>1) </b>Calculate based on thousands of threads, forums and pages analyzed on the internet <b> Ex: "What was the trendiest color in 2019?" </b>
<br><b>2) </b>Large data processing capabilities such as retrieving statistical data quickly <b>Ex: "What is the percentage of people who like the color red in the world?"</b> 
<br><b>3) </b>Real comparative capabilities. <b>Ex: "Who would win a challenge between mike tyson and muhammad ali"</b>
<br><b>4) </b>Working skills such as <b>"Locate me this ip: 150.120.x.x"</b> or <b>"Give me informations about this ip: 150.120.x.x"</b>
<br><b>5) </b>To do homework or perform non-complex exercises.  <b>Ex: "If I have 100 euros can I buy 1000 meters of cat6 ethernet cable?"</b>
<br><b>6) </b>Ask for advice, for example "Recommend me a slogan for my smartphone sales company located near the sea"
<br><b>7) </b>Translator <b>Ex: "Translate hello in italian"</b>
<br><b>8) </b>It understand and respond very well in multiple languages.

## HOW MANY LANGUAGES DOES IT WORK WITH?
It is able to speak five languages: English, F.3rench, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian.

## SCHEME OF THE ALGORITHM ON WHICH IT IS BASED:
This algorithm respect five senses of intelligent automation     |     A simple scheme about work levels <br>
